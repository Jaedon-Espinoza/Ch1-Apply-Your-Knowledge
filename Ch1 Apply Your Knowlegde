    <p>The development of a website is a long task. <br>You first have to start off with why you want to build a website. This allows you to be able to focus on who you want your audience to be and how that will change how your website works. You can also start to consider some design elements like photos, color, and how the text is arranged.</p>
    <p>In Chapter 1 of Web Design with HTML and CSS I have learned the process of planning a website, and using a text editor.I have also learned what elements are required for a HTML Webpage and how to see when a problem occurs.</p>
