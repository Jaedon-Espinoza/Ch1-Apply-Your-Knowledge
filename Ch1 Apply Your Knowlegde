    <p>The current text editor that I am using is Visual Studio Code. It is dowloadable for most software like MacOS and Windows</p>
    <p>The devoleoment of a website is a long tast. <br>You first have to start off with why you want to build a website. This allows you to be able to focus on who you want your auidence to be<br> and how that will change how your website works. You can also start to consider some design elements like photos, color, and how the text is arranged.</p>
    <p>In Chapter 1 of Web Design with HTML and CSS I have learned the process of planning a website, and using a text editor.<br>I have also learned what elements are required for a HTML Webpage and how to see when a problem occurs.</p>
